# Stellar SDK Source Testing
This project streams public transactions and parses through the latest release of the [Scala Stellar SDK](https://github.com/Synesso/scala-stellar-sdk#stellar-sdk-for-scala), testing for failures.

The github action runs hourly. Every public transaction and ledger is parsed.
