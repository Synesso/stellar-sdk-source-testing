# Stellar SDK Source Testing
This project streams public transactions and parses through the latest release of the [Scala Stellar SDK](https://github.com/Synesso/scala-stellar-sdk#stellar-sdk-for-scala), testing for failures.

[This build runs hourly](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Synesso/stellar-sdk-source-testing). Every public transaction is parsed.
